# Getting Started Context

When working on getting started documentation:

## Primary Source Files

Check these files first:

- `examples/` - Example code and notebooks
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests (show real usage)
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `docker-compose.yaml` - Local development setup

## Validation Priority

1. Verify all commands are runnable
2. Verify example outputs match actual behavior
3. Verify prerequisites are complete and accurate

## Audience Assumptions

- Users are new to the product
- Assume minimal prior knowledge
- Prioritize working examples over comprehensive options
