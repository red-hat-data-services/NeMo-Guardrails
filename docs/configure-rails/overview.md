# Configuration Overview

Before using the NeMo Guardrails Library, you need to prepare configuration files that define your guardrails behavior. When you initialize the library's core classes or the `nemoguardrails` CLI chat or server, it will load the configuration files you'll create in the next chapter [Run Rails](../run-rails/index.md). This section provides complete instructions on preparing your configuration files and executable scripts.

A guardrails configuration includes the following components. You can start with a basic configuration and add more components as needed. All the components should be placed in the `config` folder, and the locations in the following table are relative to the `config` folder.

| Component                    | Required/Optional | Description                                                                                                                                                                      | Location        |
|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Core Configuration**       | Required          | A `config.yml` file that contains the core configuration options such as which LLM(s) to use, general instructions (similar to system prompts), sample conversation, which rails are active, and specific rails configuration options. | `config.yml`           |
| **Colang Flows**             | Optional          | A collection of Colang files (`.co` files) implementing the rails.                                                                                                               | `rails` folder         |
| **Custom Actions**           | Optional          | Python functions decorated with `@action()` that can be called from Colang flows during request processing (for example, external API calls, validation logic).                                 | `actions.py` or `actions/` folder |
| **Custom Initialization**    | Optional          | Python code that runs once at startup to register custom LLM providers, embedding providers, or shared resources (for example, database connections).                                            | `config.py`            |
| **Knowledge Base Documents** | Optional          | Documents (`.md` files) that can be used in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) scenario (i.e. Retrieval rail) using the built-in Knowledge Base support.                                           | `kb` folder            |

## Example Configuration Folder Structures

The following are example configuration folder structures.

- Basic configuration

    ```text
    config/
    └── config.yml
    ```

- Configuration with Colang rails and custom actions

    ```text
    config/
    ├── config.yml
    ├── rails/
    │   ├── input.co
    │   ├── output.co
    │   └── ...
    └── actions.py          # Custom actions called from Colang flows
    ```

- Configuration with custom LLM provider registration

    ```text
    config/
    ├── config.yml
    ├── rails/
    │   └── ...
    ├── actions.py          # Custom actions
    └── config.py           # Registers custom LLM provider at startup
    ```

- Complete configuration with all components

    ```text
    config/
    ├── config.yml          # Core configuration
    ├── config.py           # Custom initialization (LLM providers, etc.)
    ├── rails/              # Colang flow files
    │   ├── input.co
    │   ├── output.co
    │   └── ...
    ├── actions/            # Custom actions (as a package)
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── validation.py
    │   ├── external_api.py
    │   └── ...
    └── kb/                 # Knowledge base documents
        ├── policies.md
        ├── faq.md
        └── ...
    ```

## Next Steps

For each component, refer to the following sections for more details:

- [Core Configuration](yaml-schema/index.md) - A complete guide to writing your `config.yml` file.
- [Colang Rails](colang/index.md) - `.co` flow files.
- [Custom Actions](actions/index.md) - `actions.py` for callable actions.
- [Custom Initialization](custom-initialization/index.md) - `config.py` for provider registration.
- [Knowledge Base Documents](other-configurations/knowledge-base.md) - `kb/` folder for RAG.

After preparing your configuration files, use the NeMo Guardrails SDK to instantiate the core classes (`RailsConfig` and `LLMRails`) and run guardrails on your LLM applications.

For detailed SDK usage, including loading configurations, generating responses, streaming, and debugging, refer to [Run Rails](../run-rails/index.md).
